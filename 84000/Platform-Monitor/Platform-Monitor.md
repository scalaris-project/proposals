## Previous Work: https://github.com/walkjivefly

## Overview: 
I am offering to create a Scalaris version of the Platform Monitor which I built for [Crown](https://monitor.crownplatform.com) and for [Blocknet](https://blocknetmonitor.com). If the proposal is successful, I will customise the code for Scalaris and install it on a new server. The proceeds will cover a year of hosting and ad-hoc maintenance. If substantial enhancements or maintenance are required they may be subject to an additional proposal.

Further, 2500 SCA from this proposal will be used as collateral for a Scalaris servicenode to increase the decentralisation and resilience of the Scalaris network and the coins available for trading.
