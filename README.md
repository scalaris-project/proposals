# Proposals
How to create a valid proposal

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create new folder with same name as the next superblock if it doesn't already exist. 
3. Then create in that folder a markdown file with the same name as the proposal. The file should contain:

* Name: Proposal name, as shown in the wallet.
* Link: URL of the proposal description in your Github repo. This will probably be too long for direct inclusion so you'll need to use a URL shortener (eg: bit.ly) 
* Owner: The name or party of who is responsible for working on this proposal. The person(s) should be involved in the creation of this proposal.
* Amount: The amount of SCA being requested and the associated dollar amount if applicable.
* Hash: The voting hash. This is not the same as the proposal creation transaction hash. 
* Previous Work:  Github link to previous proposals ( if no previous work put None ).
* Overview: As detailed as possible description of the proposal and what it encompasses.


4. Create a Pull Request.
5. Announce your proposal in the channel #proposal-overview at [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZeUMV2kcaQ).
